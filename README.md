# LibreShop [[Demo](https://demo.librepay.me)]
The LibreShop is a small dummy shop where you can use LibrePay to buy items.  It interacts with the LibrePay backend &
frontend.

## Install
Simply **put this repository somewhere on your website** (e.g. in a subdirectory). Next up you'll have to **rename** the
`config.example.php` into `config.php` and replace the values in there to fit your configuration. Also make sure you have
the `sqlite3` and `curl` **extensions enabled** in your `php.ini`.

Now you should be able to access and view the website.

*This website is live with PHP 7.2 running on a Nginx server.*

## Disclaimer
Of course none of the listed items can actually be bought and the payment process can only be completed with
testnet coins.
